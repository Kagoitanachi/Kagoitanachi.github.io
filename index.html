			<div class="information">Hello, my name is Petko Ivanov. I am a motivated software developer with several years of experience studying and working with modern programming languages. 
			I have built a strong foundation in key development technologies, which you can review in the Skills section.

			My CV and course certifications are available for download. I am eager to join a professional team, contribute my skills, and continue growing as a programmer. </div>

			 <div class = "AboutMeInformation">Outside of programming, I have a strong interest in sports, the outdoors, and the arts. I enjoy activities such as camping, 
			 attending concerts, and exploring creative fields like drawing and design.

			 I am passionate about traveling and discovering new countries and cities, as each place offers unique culture, beauty, and experiences—especially when explored during vacations.

				Among sports, my favorite is Muay Thai, which I admire not only for its physical intensity but also for the rich cultural heritage behind it. 
				I am also interested in 3D development and animation and have completed animation projects using Autodesk Maya.

				I value continuous learning and enjoy expanding my skills every day. During weekends, I like to relax by spending time outdoors—camping, drawing,
				and reconnecting with nature. My favorite live events include Rock, Metal, and Classical concerts, as well as ballet performances.</div>

			This project analyzes employee salary growth and productivity over time using Python. A dataset was created with Pandas, consisting of 10 individuals,
			each with an ID, job position, and initial annual salary.
			The analysis tracks salary progression by applying percentage-based increases after three and five years of experience,
			resulting in calculated final salaries for each stage. In parallel, the dataset includes the number of projects completed by each individual during their first through fifth year.
			Multiple visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore both compensation and productivity trends.
			These include position distribution, salary growth by years of experience, salary comparison across positions at different experience levels,
			project output in the fifth year, overall project distribution across the full period, yearly project growth rates, and total projects completed by each individual.
			This project highlights skills in time-based analysis, percentage growth calculations, performance tracking, and data visualization—key competencies for a Data Analyst role.</span>

			This project focuses on analyzing smartphone sales data for the year 2024 using Python. A structured dataset was created with Pandas, containing phone brands,
			models, and their sales figures across the year.
			The analysis explores sales performance through multiple visualizations built with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
			These include total sales per phone model, identification of the top 5 best-selling brands, analysis of the lowest-performing brand,
			and monthly sales trends for each brand and model. The final visualization is a heatmap that highlights sales distribution across phone brands.
			This project demonstrates skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend analysis, and data visualization, with a focus on extracting insights from sales data.</span>

			This project explores income, demographics, and asset distribution using a synthetic dataset created with Python and Pandas. The dataset includes 30 individuals with attributes such as
			gender, age, and monthly income for an entire year. Annual income was calculated and added as a new column for each individual to enable income-based comparisons.
			The analysis includes multiple visualizations built with Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations highlight the top 7 highest earners, monthly income trends for the first and
			last five individuals in the dataset, age distribution through a heatmap, and gender distribution across the population.
			The dataset was further enriched by adding state and city information, which was reorganized for improved structure and readability. A heatmap was created to show
			population distribution by state. Additional features include car brand ownership, car manufacturing year, and car-related fees. Visualizations were used to analyze car brand distribution,
			number of cars by manufacturing year, brand frequency, and the percentage of car fees for the first five individuals.
			This project demonstrates practical experience in data enrichment, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
			and advanced data visualization—essential skills for a Data Analyst role.</span>
